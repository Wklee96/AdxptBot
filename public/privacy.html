                    <p>5)How we use your Personal Information: In addition to the uses of your Personal Information as

                    </p>
                    <p>5.2 Transferring of information to Affiliates: We may transfer your Personal Information to our
                        affiliated entities to store such information on our behalf, or for other processing needs.
                        These
                        related entities may be based in other countries, and their servers may be located anywhere in
                        the
                        world. We require these affiliated entities to agree to process such Personal Information by
                        this
                        Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>5.3 Third Parties: There will be instances where we will share your personal information with
                        multiple
                        third parties to help our overall business operations. This transaction of data helps us to
                        understand
                        how our different users use the site, which allows the overall functionality and quality of the
                        site.
                        Examples of how we engage with third parties are with third-party HR companies who supply aid
                        when we
                        are handling job applications. Please be aware that these third-party companies will have their
                        Privacy
                        Policies. We strive to work with third parties who make their privacy policy accessible, just as
                        ours
                        is, they have no obligation to do so, or to adhere to our Privacy Policy. Our third party
                        contacts and
                        servers may be located anywhere in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>5.4 Enforcement: There may be instances where we will have to share your Personal Information
                        with any
                        third party if we believe that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary
                        to (a)
                        comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. (b) Enforce
                        the
                        Website TOU, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or
                        otherwise address fraud or security issues; and (d) protect against harm to the rights, property
                        or
                        safety of Bluenode, our users, yourself or the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>6)Publically Available Information: Any content, or information that you make publically
                        available on or
                        via the site, will be visible and publically available to other users of the site. If you
                        actively or
                        passively allow your contact information to be public, you may receive unsolicited messages or
                        activity
                        from other users of the Site. We, therefore, encourage you only to post information that you are
                        sure
                        you want to be publicly accessible.
                    </p>
                    <p>7)Access, accuracy & deletion: We always strive to maintain accurate personal information. If you
                        would
                        like to make amendments to or delete any of the personal information that you have previously
                        supplied
                        to us, we have created tools available on the site for you to do this. If you wish to delete any

                        we do not undertake to respond to, or otherwise implement, the request within any period).
                        Please be
                        aware that information deleted (whether directly by you or under a delete request) may or may
                        not be
                        permanently removed by Bluenode, and may remain stored on our servers. In such cases, the
                        information will no longer be accessible to you. We, in our sole and absolute discretion, decide

                    <p>10)Children's Privacy: Our site is not designed, nor does it want an association with children
                        under the
                        age of 13. So please note that we do not intend any Personal Information from anyone that we
                        know, or
                        suspect to be under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from
                        a child
                        under 13, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information as quickly as
                        possible. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at

                    <p>11)Security: Please be aware that we always use administrative, physical and technical safeguards
                        to
                        protect your personal information. However please acknowledge that no method of transmission
                        over the
                        Internet, or method of electronic storage, is ever 100% secure. Therefore, while we try to use
                        reasonably acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                        absolute
                        security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about safety on the Site, you can contact
                        us at

                        entity we
                        may (and have the right to) transfer and assign the Personal Information that you have supplied,
                        or we
                        have collected or received. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or
                        comparable
                        event, we may not be able to control how your Personal Information is treated, transferred, or
                        used.

                    <p>13)California Privacy Rights: California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are
                        California residents to request specific information regarding our disclosure of Personal
                        Information
                        to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this applies to you, you can submit a
                        request
                        and send an email to <a href="cheunghoyeung@adxpert.co">cheunghoyeung@adxpert.co</a>
                        Please be aware that we are only required to respond to

                    <p>14)Our California 'Do Not Track' Notice: At present we do not currently respond, nor take any
                        action
                        concerning the web browser 'do not track' signals, or any other application that can provide our
                        consumers with the ability to select how the collection of personal data is acquired. There may
                        be
                        times when we may allow third parties, such as analytic companies to gather Personal Information
                        about
                        specific consumers' online activities over time, and across various sites.

                    <p>15)Deletion of Content for California Residents: If you currently are a resident of California
                        and are
                        under the age of 18 and a registered user of the Site (for example, if you have an Account),
                        California
                        Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to remove content or information you
                        have
                        publicly posted. If you wish to remove such content or information and you specify which content
                        or
                        information you want to be removed, we will do so by applicable law. Please be aware that after
                        removal
                        you will not be able to restore deleted content or information. Also, such removal does not
                        ensure
                        complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there
                        may be
                        circumstances in which the law does not require us to enable removal of the content or
                        information.
